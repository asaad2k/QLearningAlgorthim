# 🚀 SelfLearningAI: AI That Learns & Evolves 🎯

QLearningAgent is a **reinforcement learning project** that implements a **Q-learning algorithm** with **priority replay buffer** and **genetic algorithms**. This project aims to develop an agent that continuously learns from its environment, improving decision-making over time.

## 📌 Project Overview  
In this project, we develop an **intelligent agent** that interacts with an environment and learns using **Q-learning**, an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent:  
✅ Uses **priority replay buffer** to store past experiences efficiently  
✅ Implements **genetic algorithms** to enhance its learning process  
✅ Learns optimal strategies **over multiple simulations**  
✅ Uses **visualization tools** to track its training progress

## 📊 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Agent-Environment Interaction**  
   - The agent interacts with an environment and makes decisions.  
   - Actions are taken based on a policy that gets updated over time.  

2️⃣ **Priority Replay Buffer**  
   - Stores past experiences efficiently.  
   - Prioritizes important experiences for better learning.  

3️⃣ **Q-Learning Algorithm**  
   - Updates the agent’s knowledge based on past rewards.  
   - Uses a reward-based system to optimize decision-making.  

4️⃣ **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**  
   - Fine-tunes learning parameters over multiple iterations.  
   - Improves exploration and exploitation balance.  

5️⃣ **Visualization & Analysis**  
   - Tracks training progress using graphs.  
   - Compares different learning strategies.
